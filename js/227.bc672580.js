They have shown high potential for detecting patterns in images, enabling faster and more efficient work for specialists. Transformers represent a new architecture of deep neural networks, which have been particularly successful in natural language processing, but have also been successfully applied to image tasks, surpassing previous methods based on convolutional networks. The use of transformers in medicine is still an area of active research in the scientific community. This work analyzes existing methods for processing medical images using transformers. A particular challenge in the medical field is the lack of training data. Therefore, the focus is on methods that use the concept of visual prompts, which allow for the efficient adaptation of large models to medical image tasks. A novel method for image processing using transformer architecture is proposed. The methods are evaluated on publicly available datasets, and their effectiveness is compared to other published solutions.
